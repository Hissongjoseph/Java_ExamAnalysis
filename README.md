# Java_ExamAnalysis
Java Programming- User will input User ID and 5 exam scores

After user inputs the exams, the program will calculate the average (after dropping the lowest grade) and
assign a letter grade accordingly.

One of the first Java Programs that I created... Looking back at it, you can see how bad the structure is!

In the near future, I will go back and recreate it to show the difference a few years can do!
